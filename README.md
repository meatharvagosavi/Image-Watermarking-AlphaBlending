# Image-Watermarking-AlphaBlending
fully reproducible implementation of the research paper “Image Watermarking Using Alpha Blending Approach in Spatial Domain” (JETIR, 2019). The project shows how to embed a visible watermark into a cover image using linear alpha blending and how to extract it back using the inverse alpha formula.
